###Iterative Fibonacci with ulimited integers
Fibonacci grows very fast beyond 20. In fact, the longest integer provided by C, <br>
The unsigned long long or ULL is not enough beyond the 93rd Fibonacci number. 
<br>The tiny integer library written for the purpose provides a practically unlimited container.<br>
Though there are constraints, first the memory on your RAM and second the limit of int,<br> 
which specifies the index of the number you want. Though this can be easily extended, <br>
I do not know yet how it may be useful (& verifiable!)
